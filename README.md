Introduction
The Fluent Android Copilot Chatbot is built to assist developers working with Fluent2 UI components on Android. Fluent2 is a design language developed by Microsoft that provides consistent UI patterns across different platforms, ensuring a familiar and intuitive experience for users.

This chatbot leverages Fluent2’s principles in the Android environment using Jetpack Compose, delivering practical advice on component usage, properties, and relevant examples. It is focused on:

Precise and concise answers: Tailored to the query at hand, avoiding unnecessary elaboration.
Fluent2 UI-specific guidance: Ensures responses are based on Fluent2 components, avoiding Material or XML-based solutions.
Code snippets: Provides examples using Jetpack Compose syntax, enabling developers to apply them quickly.
Benefits of Fluent Android Copilot Chatbot
Instant answers to queries related to Fluent2 UI components.
Interactive and dynamic way to learn about the Fluent2 design system in an Android context.
Official documentation links are provided for developers to explore in more depth.
How to Create the Chatbot
To create your own Fluent Android Copilot Chatbot, follow these steps:

Design the User Interface: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the web interface. Ensure that it follows the Fluent2 design system with proper typography, color schemes, and layout.

Integrate the Chatbot: Connect your web interface to a chatbot service. You can host your chatbot using platforms like Microsoft Azure Bot Service or Dialogflow. In this project, we use the Microsoft Copilot Chatbot, which is embedded using an <iframe> in the HTML file.

Use Fluent2 Design Principles: Ensure all user interface elements adhere to Fluent2 standards, using Jetpack Compose for the Android-specific elements in code examples.

Deploy on GitHub Pages or Other Hosting Services: Once the chatbot is built, deploy it on a static web hosting platform like GitHub Pages. You can configure your repository to host the chatbot directly.

Dataset Creation: Use the Python tool to create a dataset that feeds into the chatbot. The tool fetches the necessary code snippets from repositories and transforms them into training data for the chatbot.

Features
Interactive Chatbot: Engage with a chatbot that answers questions about Fluent2 components in Android using Jetpack Compose.
Precise Responses: Get concise and relevant answers with code snippets for specific queries.
Fluent2 Focus: Designed exclusively for Fluent2 UI, providing accurate, Compose-only solutions.
Official Documentation Links: Quick access to detailed information from official sources.
Python Tool for Dataset Creation
The Python tool included in this project is used to fetch codebases from GitHub repositories and create datasets based on Kotlin code snippets. This dataset can then be used to train the chatbot, enhancing its ability to provide relevant and helpful answers.

How It Works
Fetch the Codebase: The tool clones a GitHub repository or accesses it via the GitHub API to fetch files.
Extract Relevant Files: It scans the repository for Kotlin code and other relevant file types (.kt, .gradle, .xml, etc.).
Generate Dataset: The tool creates a structured dataset that includes code snippets, formatted as input-output pairs. This dataset can then be used to train or refine the chatbot's responses.
Running the Python Tool
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fluent-android-copilot.git
Navigate to the Python tool directory and run it:

bash
Copy code
cd python-tool-directory
python dataset_creator.py
The tool will fetch the repository code and create a JSON file containing the dataset for training the chatbot.

Technologies Used
Kotlin: Primary language for Android development.
Jetpack Compose: UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces.
Fluent2 UI: Design system for creating engaging and consistent experiences.
Python: Used for building the dataset creation tool.
GitHub: Version control for managing and hosting the project.
Installation and Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fluent-android-copilot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd fluent-android-copilot
Run the Python tool (if you want to create or update the dataset):

bash
Copy code
cd python-tool-directory
python dataset_creator.py
Open the HTML file in a browser to run the chatbot interface.

Running the Project
To Run the Chatbot:
Deploy the website:
You can host the chatbot using GitHub Pages by enabling Pages under the repository’s settings and selecting the appropriate source branch and folder (e.g., docs or root).
Interact with the chatbot:
Open the hosted page and start interacting with the Fluent Android Copilot Chatbot.
